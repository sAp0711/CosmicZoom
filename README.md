# Cosmic Zoom
## Overview
The **Cosmic Zoom** is a web application designed to allow users to explore NASA’s high-resolution image datasets, ranging from gigapixel to terapixel scale. The app enables interactive zooming and panning, and labelling of known features. By providing an intuitive interface and adaptive image streaming, the platform makes vast space datasets accessible to researchers, educators, and the general public.
